from datetime import datetime

datetime_object = datetime.strptime('Jun 1 2005  1:33PM', '%b %d %Y %I:%M%p')

The resulting datetime object is timezone-naive.

Links:

    Python documentation for strptime: Python 2, Python 3

    Python documentation for strftime format mask: Python 2, Python 3

    This is also a really nice reference for strftime

Notes:

    strptime = "string parse time"
    strftime = "string format time"
    Pronounce it out loud today & you won't have to search for it again in 6 months.
