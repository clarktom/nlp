i recently had the same problem..

i solved it by doing:

import sys, os

# reopen stdout with "newline=None".
# in this mode,
# input:  accepts any newline character, outputs as '\n'
# output: '\n' converts to os.linesep

sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), "w", newline=None)

for i in range(1,10):
        print(i)

this works on both unix and windows ... have not tested it on macosx ...
