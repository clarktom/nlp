You can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module.

fibo.py (a module named fibo)

# Other modules can IMPORT this MODULE to use the function fib
def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        print(b, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

# This allows the file to be used as a SCRIPT
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))
