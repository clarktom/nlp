def finder(myList, target)
    diff = ''
    index = None
    for i,num in enumerate(myList):
        if abs(target - num) < diff:
            diff = abs(target - num)
            index = i
    return index

Hope this helps

EDIT:

If you'd like a one-liner, then you might like this better:

min(L, key=lambda x: abs(target-x))
